Regression Model
- Estimating continuous probabilities rather than discrete categories.

Regression: predict the probabilities for each outcome (win, lose, draw) as continuous values that sum to 1

Architecture
1. Data Collection
	Collect historical data
		Match outcomes (win, lose, draw)
		Team statistics (e.g., goals scored, goals conceded, player stats)
		Contextual data (e.g., home/away status, weather conditions)

2. Data Preprocessing
	Clean the data and handle missing values.
	Encode categorical variables (e.g., teams, venues).
	Normalize or standardize numerical features.
	
3. Feature Engineering
	Create relevant features:
		Recent form of teams (last 5 matches)
		Head-to-head statistics
		Home/away advantage
		Player injuries or suspensions
		
4. Model Selection
	Linear Regression: Simple but may not capture complex relationships.
	Logistic Regression: Can be adapted for multi-class outcomes using softmax for categorical outcomes.
	Decision Trees/Random Forests: Handle non-linear relationships well.
	Gradient Boosting: XGBoost or LightGBM can provide strong performance.
	Neural Networks: If you have a large dataset, a neural network can learn complex patterns.
	
5. Training
	Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
	Train your model on the training set.

6. Output Layer
	Ensure the output layer is set to predict three values (win, lose, draw) using a softmax activation function to ensure they sum to 1.
	
7. Evaluation Metrics
	Use metrics suitable for regression:
		Mean Squared Error (MSE)
		Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
		R-squared, if applicable.
		
8. Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning
	Implement cross-validation to validate your model's performance.
	Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to optimize hyperparameters.
	
Neural Network Architecture
	Input Layer: Number of features (e.g., team stats, match context)
	Hidden Layers: 2-3 layers with 64-128 neurons each, using ReLU activation
	Output Layer: 3 neurons (for win, lose, draw) with softmax activation
